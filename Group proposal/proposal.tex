\title{}\textbf{AUTOMATED MOBILE SYSTEM TO IMPROVE ON PATIENTS’ APPOINTMENT WITH DOCTORS TO REDUCE DEATHRATES OF CANCER PATIENTS IN UGANDA.
} 


\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background}

\paragraph{•}Cancer has become an epidemic that is on a high rise in the recent years and there are not so many hospitals that have proper facilities well equipped to have this disease treated properly and mortality rates are rising as the victims are taken to their early graves as due to a lack of proper treatment since well-defined information details about these Cancer oncologists specialised in treating Cancer in Uganda.

\paragraph{•}Cancer a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Not all tumours are cancerous; benign tumours do not spread to other parts of the body. There are also benign which are noncancerous bone tumours, and are more common than malignant ones. There are some common signs that indicate if a person has or is developing cancer in a particular bone like pain, swellings, fractures, weight loss and fatigue as well as numbness and general weakness of the body of the victim. 

\paragraph{•}Treatment of Cancer can only be done after discovery of the cancer in the body of the individual through regular medical check-ups and self-test exams mostly during the physical medical examinations is when doctors tend to discover the presence of this deadly disease and after its discovery in the victim’s body part in particular there are many varying treatment procedures your oncologist (medical specialists who treat cancer) can administer with their consent  depending on the type and level the cancer has grown so far like a low level cancer primarily surgery has been the ideal treatment and high level or severe cancer growth is treated using a combination of treatments like surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy and all these have been included in the cancer care treatment plan that your oncologist has provided which can also include after side effects of treatment, monitoring and performing regular medical check-ups to ensure safety of the patient.

\paragraph{•}Cancer can be detected if one goes for image scans like X-rays, CT, MRIs, radionuclide bone and positron emission tomography (pet) scans as well as biopsy which can clearly be used to clearly identify the presence of cancer cells.

\paragraph{•}The hustle to discover that one has Cancer is tiresome and frustrating more so when finding the medical specialists and getting treatment for the Cancer for example one has to move from their home areas to the Uganda Cancer Institute at Mulago national referral hospital to acquire treatment and assistance in regards to their illness which is very costly and cumbersome to patients all due to the limited ways of acquiring all this information about the specialists who have established themselves with good years of experience, recognised and brilliant in practice treatment of Cancer with well-known and trusted hospitals at ones’ convenient time and means. Highly established hospitals and health institutes for the treatment of Cancer is limited in Uganda mostly known to be stationed in Kampala.

\paragraph{•}The automated web application system will help narrow this inadequacy of information about these oncologists in Kampala and Uganda defining their details of location, office contacts, hospital base of practice.

\subsection{Problem Statement}
\paragraph{•}Limited access to Cancer medical specialists’ information by the general public. This is due to inadequate access and availability of Cancer specialists information in the country making the existing system very hard to work with and very costly in terms of having access to information about cancer oncologists, well trained to treat cancer in registered hospitals  ,patients are forced to move up to the hospitals for information inquiry thus the need for the development of a new system of accessing this information at their comfort.


\subsection{Main Objective}
\paragraph{•}To develop an automated web application system in an information deprived environment to provide information to the public about these oncologists to their conveniences.


\subsection{Specific Objectives}
\paragraph{•}The Specific Objectives of the study are as follows:
\paragraph{•}i.	To investigate the challenges of the current system and collect user requirements for the development of the automated web application system.
\paragraph{•}ii.	To analyse and determine the user requirements for the automated web application system.
\paragraph{•}iii.	To design and implement the automated web application system to meet the above the system requirements for the specified disease medical specialists in Uganda.  
\paragraph{•}iv.	To test and validate the implemented automated web application system with the proposed users.
