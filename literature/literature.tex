\title{•}\textbf{LITERATURE REVIEW ON ANDROID APPLICATION DEVELOPED ON ECLIPSE SOFTWARE.}

\section{Introduction}

\paragraph{•}Now is an exciting time for mobile developers. Android [2] is an open source architecture that includes the operating system, middleware, and its key applications along with a set of API libraries for writing mobile applications that can shape the look, feel, and function of mobile handsets. Mobile developers can now expand into the Android platform to enhance existing products. Without any artificial barriers, Android developers write applications that take full advantage of increasingly powerful mobile hardware. Mobile applications are a rapidly growing segment of the global mobile market. In this paper, we discuss on Android mobile platform for the mobile application development, layered approach for android. Google released Android which is an open-source mobile phone operating system which is Linux-based. Android becomes the most widely used OS on mobile phones.  Android [1] is mobile operating systems designed for increasingly powerful mobile hardware. 


\subsection{Platform overview}
\paragraph{•}Android is a software stack which is for only mobile devices. The Android SDK provides the tools. APIs necessary to begin developing applications on the Android platform using the Java programming language [3]. Android based on Linux version 2.6. The system services such as security, memory management, process management are controlled by Linux.

\subsection{Fundamentals}
\paragraph{•}Android applications are written in Java programming language. They are not executed using the standard Java Virtual Machine (JVM).[5] Google has created a custom VM called Dalvik which is responsible for converting and executing Java byte code. All custom Java classes must be converted into a Dalvik compatible instruction set before being executed into an Android operating system.

\subsection{Development}
\paragraph{•}The Android SDK provides set of application programming interfaces (APIs). Android applications can share data among one another and also access shared resources on the system securely [4].

\subsection{Component Classes And Methods}
\paragraph{•}The Android SDK [6] has a base class for each type of component (Activity, Service, Receiver, and Provider), with callback methods that are invoked at various points in the life cycle of the associated component.
